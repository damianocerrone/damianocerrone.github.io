Iâ€™m an urbanist by trade, working across disciplines and institutions to make data meaningful and advance urban education. I design and lead research projects for the public and private sectors while developing academic research and courses. In 2013 I co-founded [SPIN Unit](https://www.spinunit.eu){:target="_blank"}, a resaerch and innovation lab with good intentions based in Tallinn and Helsinki. On this webpage I share selected projects, publications, and miscellanea I made independently, or as representatives for the organizations I worked with, such as [SPIN Unit](https://www.spinunit.eu){:target="_blank"}, [Demos Helsinki](https://demoshelsinki.fi){:target="_blank"}, [Tampere University](https://www.tuni.fi/en/about-us/faculty-built-environment){:target="_blank"}, [TalTech](https://taltech.ee/en/finest-centre-for-smart-cities){:target="_blank"}, [Akkadian](https://akkadian.eu/en){:target="_blank"}, and [Terreform CAUR](https://www.terreform.info){:target="_blank"}.

I work in &rarr; [a Real Space](https://goo.gl/maps/mjqjcATKGVqVoeaN6){:target="_blank"} in the redhill of Helsinki. The door is open. For more, talks and projects write me at [me@damianocerrone.info](me@damianocerrone.info) or find an available time slot to talk [here](https://fantastical.app/damianocerrone/meeting-op){:target="_blank"}.


**More over** Digital connectivity challenges the supremacy of physical space in explaining how we use and experience the urban and natural landscape. Entirely new patterns of local and regional phenomena are emerging within the social fabric. My work builds bridges between scientific research and the urban management practice to enrish the decision making process with digital urban analysis and an informed advice to policymaker. In the past years, I worked to design the Urban Meta-morphology framework, which includes methods and toolboxes to analyze city form, activity patterns, and socio-economic metrics to map the relations between the tangible and the intangible forms of the city.
