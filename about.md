I'm an urbanist by trade, working across disciplines and institutions to make data meaningful and advance urban education. I design and lead research projects for the public and private sectors while developing university courses. I work in [a Real Space](https://goo.gl/maps/mjqjcATKGVqVoeaN6) in the redhill of Helsinki. The door is open.

**More over**
Digital connectivity challenges the supremacy of physical space in explaining how we use and experience the urban landscape. Entirely new patterns of local, urban, and regional phenomena are emerging within the urban fabric. These phenomena often remain undiscovered and unmapped by local authorities. Successful and attractive urban spaces are no longer those planned according to well-established guidelines, but those derived from processes of activity clustering. At the same time, city planning offices still rely on old instruments based on land use and socio-economic indicators that, more often than not, are no longer able to effectively capture the complexity of the information-based nature of our cities. This limitation makes it hard for planning offices to keep step with gentrification processes and loss of land value in very central urban areas.

My work builds bridges between scientific research and urban management, to innovate in urban planning practice through digital urban analysis and policy making. In this talk, I will present the Urban Meta-morphology framework, which includes a method and a toolbox to analyse spatial accessibility, activity patterns, and socio-economic metrics to map the relations between the tangible and the intangible forms of the city. I developed my practice as Founder and Principal Researcher at SPIN Unit, a transnational research team that has already deployed the meta-morphological approach to provide insight for over 100 cities in Europe and Russia.

**Short bio**

Damiano Cerrone is co-founder of SPIN Unit, a research, and innovation practice based in Helsinki (FIN) and Tallinn (EST). At SPIN, he works on the lab's three core initiatives of making data meaningful, innovating interactions, and advancing urban education. Cerrone also has an expert role at TalTech FinEst Center for Smart Cities, and he taught urban studies in several universities in Europe, the USA, and China. Cerrone focuses his academic research on urban analytics and studying the relationship between urban biodiversity and public health. He worked as a consultant for more than 10 years, principally for the public sector, leading research for European cities, regions, and ministries.
