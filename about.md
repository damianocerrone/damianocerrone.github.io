I'm an urbanist by trade, working across disciplines and institutions to make data meaningful and advance urban education. I design and lead research projects for the public and private sectors while developing university courses. I work in [a Real Space](https://goo.gl/maps/mjqjcATKGVqVoeaN6) in the redhill of Helsinki. The door is open.
