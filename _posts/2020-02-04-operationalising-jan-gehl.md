Our paper presents a method to operationalise Jan Gehl’s categorisation of urban activity patterns using Foursquare data. To do that we present the ‘Urban Activity Wheel’, a method that is instrumental in showing how location based social media data can be used to rank the diversity of optional and necessary activities. This approach can be used to unearths emerging activity patterns across scales from local to regional scale, without the need for site analyses.
