The metaMorphology Lab was is summer school I co-directed with Lev Manovich part of the 2016 Summer school devoted to exploring new methods for social and cultural research. The laboratory explored the landscape of the invisible city, using digital traces to unveil, measure and study the meta-morphology of the city. Participants explored location-based social media to map the collective image of the city.
