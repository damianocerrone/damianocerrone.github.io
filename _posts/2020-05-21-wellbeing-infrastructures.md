Advanced Urban Analysis, a course I teach at Tampere University, is a collaboration between different faculties that share the common themes of green transition and supporting sustainable urban structures. In the Fall 2020 the theme was looked through spatial boundary conditions of a wider spectrum of wellbeing. The course was carried out in a collaboration with HYMY, a project coordinated by the Tampere City Region to better understand the raltionship between wellbeing and city form. The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare and the cities of Jyväskylä, Kuopio, Lahti and Tampere were also involved.
