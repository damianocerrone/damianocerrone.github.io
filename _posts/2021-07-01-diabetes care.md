title: An association between biodiversity and T1 diabetes.
---

The study we carried out at Tampere University suggests that exposure to an agricultural environment early in life is inversely associated with the risk of type 1 diabetes. This indicates that children spending their early life in areas characteries by high biodiversity are less likely to develop T1 diabetes later in life. This association was established by comparing land cover types between children who developed type 1 diabetes and children who did not. The datasets utilized were blood samples of 10,681 children at high risk of developing diabetes from birth and a control group of 10,279 children from the same geographic areas.
