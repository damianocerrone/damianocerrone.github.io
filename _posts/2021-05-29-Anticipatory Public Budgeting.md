title: A report on Anticipatory Public Budgeting
---

Governaments are constantly faceing complex long-term challenges: from handling demographic transitions to climate change, navigating the fourth industrial revolution to managing pensions. These challenges require actions that need to be implemented today but have to be budgeted for the long-term. However, many of the propsecting and budgetting methods used by governments are designed for the short-term.

In this report I co-authored at [Demos Helsinki](https://demoshelsinki.fi/referenssit/a-multimodal-approach-for-sustainable-cross-border-transit/){:target="_blank"} and delivered to The Mohammed Bin Rashid Centre for Government Innovation, we presented strategies to help governments align their financing decisions with their longer term strategic objectives, and to address the imbalance between their long-term goals and their usually shortterm financial tools.
