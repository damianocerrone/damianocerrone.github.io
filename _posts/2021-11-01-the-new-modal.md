title: The new modal. A framework for equitable public transit stops
---

The transportation sector is renewing attention to equality and how power imbalances became embedded in cities and regionsâ€™ transit services. One of the tangible consequences of the status quo is the upholding of invisible barriers that hold back a just and equitable transformation of our cities. Transportation systems and routes are commonly optimised to increase the system-level efficiency of daily transit. In that case, we must ask ourselves: whose efficiency has been prioritised?

The Harju county financed a study to produce the first mobility equity map of the region and draft a policy strategy to make public transit more equitable across different municipalities.  The project utilised used real-time public transport data, together with on-site surveys, to establish a regional equity rank in Estonia.
