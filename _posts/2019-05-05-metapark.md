title: A performance based parking policy for Tallinn.
---

Ensuring a cityâ€™s success based on urban assets requires physical connections, proximities, urban density and a high diversity of activities. This usually comes with a heavy dose of space dedicated to parking vehicles, which, inversely to what is generally thought, can hinder local economic growth, social cohesion and the overall quality of life.

metaPark aimed to draft a parking policy reform in Tallinn, harnessing the real economic value of parking space and returning it to the city. We first embarked on the challenge to map each single parking space in the city, formal or not, by combining real-time parking data with satellite imagery and on-site surveys. This allowed measuring the actual occupancy rates of all paid-parking spots collected in real-time and proposing a data-informed policy reform.

Our suggestion was the introduction of the ATA (Active Transit Area): a simple and actionable model that links the paid parking area and its cost to the efficiency of public transit. In a nutshell: on-street parking is on payment where public transport is fast efficient, and the more cars are parking, the higher the hourly rate. This model establishes a positive feedback loop in which:
the more Tallinn invests in public transport; the wider is the paid-parking zone
The wider is the paid parking zone; the more fees can be collected by the city to improve public transit.
The more public transit is improved; the more money people will have in their pockets, as public transit is free of charge in Tallinn. 
The more people will use public transit instead of cars; the more people will see their quality of life improve.
...and overall, it will improve the social equity of Tallinn, as there will be fewer frictions between the already polarised debate between drivers and non-drivers.
