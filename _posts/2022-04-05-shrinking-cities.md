In 2018 the Ministry of Finance received dozens of apartments from Ida-Virumaa after the municipality of Kohtla-JÃ¤rve informed citizens and apartment associations that they could give unwanted apartments to the state.

Shrinkage has long been discussed and studied in Estonia from a demographic, economic and social perspective - starting with the periodical prognoses by Statistics Estonia to the most recent report "Shrinking Smartly in Estonia" by the OECD. 

However, the rise of voluntary restitutions spun a new branch of investigation, focusing on the relationships between demographic change and the built environment. Doing that meant that instead of looking at shrinking cities from a demographic perspective, research had to focus on the vacancy of every dwelling to understand the building types that are more vulnerable to depopulation.

In 2019 we started working as a research pilot to design a new methodology to map vacancy rates of apartment buildings using electricity data. After completing this project, in 2021, the Estonian Ministry of Economic and Communication commissioned a national study in which we had the opportunity to scale up our methodology.
